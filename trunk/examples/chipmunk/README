This directory contains examples of how to use the Chipmunk physics library.
They are based on the examples that come with the Chipmunk source
distribution. These examples were translated to Scrupp/Lua and use the Lua
library Werechipmunk to access the functionality of Chipmunk. The graphics 
are created on the fly using Cairo.
