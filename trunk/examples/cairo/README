All the example files in this directory were taken from lua-oocairo-1.2, a 
binding from Cairo to the Lua programming language written by Geoff Richards.

The original example files created a png image file in most of the cases. 
This was changed, so now they all use Scrupp to display the Cairo surfaces.

Remember that Cairo surfaces become OpenGL textures in Scrupp, so you can 
manipulate them with the hardware accelerated methods provided by OpenGL, 
e.g. rotation and scaling.
