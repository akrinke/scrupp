This directory contains the original examples of LuaSocket.
They DO NOT use Scrupp but the command line for interaction.

Just open them with Scrupp on a command line.

On Windows, these examples won't work as expected, because 
there is no possibility to interact with scrupp on the 
command line (e.g. send input to scrupp).
