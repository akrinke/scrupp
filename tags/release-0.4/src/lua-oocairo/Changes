1.2     2008-11-07

 * Integration with Lua-Gnome for drawing in GUIs:
    + New constructor: context_create_gdk
    + New methods on contexts to set source based on Gdk object:
      set_source_gdk_color, set_source_pixbuf, set_source_pixmap
    + New method on image surfaces: get_gdk_pixbuf
    + Examples which show Cairo drawing in GUI applications.
 * Translate between image surfaces and raw pixel data:
    + New constructor: image_surface_create_from_data
    + New method on image surfaces: get_data
      (based on a patch by Julien Danjou)
    + New top-level function 'format_stride_for_width' and constant
      'BYTE_ORDER' to allow creating suitable data for constructor

1.1     2008-10-17

 * Include MacOS X makefile, and fix compilation bug with Cairo 1.8,
   both thanks to Asko Kauppi.
 * Added font options objects:
    + New constructor: font_options_create
    + New getter method 'get_font_options' on context and surface classes
    + New setter method 'set_font_options' on context class
 * Added scaled font objects:
    + New constructor: scaled_font_create
    + Accessors on context class: get_scaled_font, set_scaled_font
 * Most of the new functionality in Cairo 1.8 is now bound:
    + New font face constructor functions: toy_font_face_create,
      user_font_face_create
    + New methods on toy font faces: get_family, get_slant, get_weight
    + The 'text_to_glyphs' method on scaled fonts, and 'show_text_glyphs'
      method on context objects, with text clusters bound as a Lua table.
    + New 'has_show_text_glyphs' method on surface objects
    + New feature flag: HAS_USER_FONT
 * Plugged memory leaks in some functions which accept a table of glyphs.
